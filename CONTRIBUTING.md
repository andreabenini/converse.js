## Quickstart

### With GNU Make:

```
make serve_bg
make watch
```

### Without GNU Make:

```
npm install
npm run serve &
npm run watch
```

Go to http://localhost:8000/dev.html

Then modify `dev.html` so that `converse.initialize()` is called with relevant settings.

Webpack will "watch" the source files and automatically recreate the build if they
are modified. So you don't have to do anything to rebuild whenever you've
change something in a file but you will have to manually reload the browser tab
to see the changes in the browser.


## Live reloading

If you want to have live reloading whenever any of the source files change, you
can run ``make devserver`` (or ``npm run devserver``).

Then go to http://localhost:8080

Then modify `webpack.html` so that `converse.initialize()` is called with relevant settings.
